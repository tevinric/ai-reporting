Please help when I try to add a new monthly metric, I get the following errors in terminal of backend:


ERROR:__main__:Error saving metrics: ('42000', '[42000] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server][SQL Server]Error converting data type nvarchar to numeric. (8114) (SQLExecDirectW)')

Please also help with the metrics. 

Under the management tab we have a whole bunch of metrics available. 
In the Initiatives page when I click to add monthly metrics, I only see customer experience score, Time saved, Cost saved, Model accuracy, User Adoption rate. 

I want the user to be able to add more metrics for any initiative they want from the list of available metrics.

Also please ensure that all selected metrics that have data available will have trend lines established for them so that people can view the trend of perfomance according to these metrics.
