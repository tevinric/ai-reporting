Please help when I making updates to the initiatives tab and saving changes, I am getting the following error: 


ERROR:__main__:Error updating initiative: ('22007', '[22007] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server][SQL Server]Conversion failed when converting date and/or time from character string. (241) (SQLExecDirectW)')


PLease also fix the colors of the Health. I have an app that is Green but the DOT is red. Please make the colors be synchronised with the selection.
