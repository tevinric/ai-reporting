## ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Aggregate Monthly ROI Trends

**Requirement:**
> The Monthly ROI trends must aggregate across all projects.

**Implementation:**

### Backend Aggregation (backend/app.py)
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/dashboard/monthly-trends` (Lines 136-218)

**Features:**
- Parses all `additional_metrics` JSON from all initiatives
- Aggregates metrics by period across ALL projects
- Calculates totals, averages, and counts for each metric
- Returns structured data: `{metric_name}_total`, `{metric_name}_avg`, `{metric_name}_count`

**Aggregation Logic:**
```python
# For each period:
- Sum all values across initiatives (total)
- Calculate average value (avg)
- Count number of initiatives (count)
```

### Frontend Display (frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js)
**Individual Charts per Metric** (Lines 265-357)

**Features:**
- Separate chart for each metric being tracked
- Shows both **Total** (solid line) and **Average** (dashed line)
- Responsive grid layout
- Latest values displayed below each chart (Total/Avg/Initiative count)
- Click any chart to drill down

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Paginated Table with All Projects

**Requirement:**
> Please include a paginated table showing the status and details of each project.

**Implementation:**

### Paginated Initiatives Table (Lines 359-470)

**Features:**
1. **Complete Initiative List**:
   - Shows all initiatives in system
   - Total count in header
   - Comprehensive details per row

2. **Displayed Information**:
   - Initiative name + description preview
   - Status badge (color-coded)
   - Health indicator (Green/Amber/Red)
   - Departments
   - Benefit category
   - Progress bar with percentage
   - View button to navigate

3. **Pagination Controls**:
   - 10 items per page
   - Previous/Next buttons
   - Current page indicator
   - Disabled state when at ends
   - Clean navigation UI

**Pagination Logic:**
```javascript
const totalPages = Math.ceil(allInitiatives.length / 10);
const paginatedInitiatives = allInitiatives.slice(
  (currentPage - 1) * 10,
  currentPage * 10
);
```

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Clickable Drilldown

**Requirement:**
> All visuals on the dashboard must be able to be clicked to drill down and expand to show per initiative.

2. **Metric Drill-Down** (Lines 272-325)
   - `GET /api/dashboard/metric/<metric_name>`
   - Returns all initiatives tracking this metric
   - Organized by period with values and comments

### Frontend Drill-Down Features

1. **Clickable Metric Charts** (Lines 289-307)
   - Hover effect (lift + shadow)
   - Cursor changes to pointer
   - Click opens drilldown modal

   - Close button + click outside to dismiss

**Drill-Down Views:**

**Period View:**

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/api/dashboard/stats` | Dashboard statistics |
| GET | `/api/dashboard/monthly-trends` | Aggregated metrics across all projects |
| GET | `/api/dashboard/period/<period>` | Drilldown: initiatives for specific period |
| GET | `/api/dashboard/metric/<metric_name>` | Drilldown: initiatives tracking specific metric |

### Data Flow

**Aggregation:**
```
monthly_metrics (all initiatives)
  → Parse additional_metrics JSON
  → Group by period
  → Aggregate per metric (sum, avg, count)
  → Return structured trend data
```

**Drill-Down:**
```
Click metric chart
  → Fetch initiatives with that metric
  → Display in modal by period
  → Click initiative → Navigate to detail
```
