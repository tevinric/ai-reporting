This is great. 

I am having an issue with adding Monthly metric results. 

When I add a new metric onto a month that already has metrics captured then the existing metrics are being cleared and overwritten. 

I need the data to be maintained for every metric. if a user adds on a new metric to any initiative for any month then it must be added on and not replace the existing metric results. 

Please ensure that this is fixed! we need to ensure that the trends are able to be reported on. ensure that users can edit or delete metric results for previous months.
