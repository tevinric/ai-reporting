## ✅ FIXED: Metrics Overwriting Issue

**Problem:**
> When I add a new metric onto a month that already has metrics captured then the existing metrics are being cleared and overwritten.

**Root Cause:** The system was replacing the entire `additional_metrics` JSON field instead of merging new metrics with existing ones.

**Solution Implemented:**

### Backend Fix (backend/app.py)
1. **Modified POST endpoint** (Lines 489-507):
   - Fetch existing `additional_metrics` from database
   - Parse existing JSON data
   - Merge new metrics with existing using `{**existing, **new}`
   - Save merged data back to database
   - Existing metrics are preserved, new metrics are added

2. **Smart Merging Logic**:
   ```python
   # Get existing metrics
   existing_metrics = json.loads(row[1]) if row[1] else {}

   # Merge with new metrics (preserves existing, adds new)
   merged_metrics = {**existing_metrics, **new_additional_metrics}

   # Save merged data
   additional_metrics_json = json.dumps(merged_metrics)
   ```

**Result:** ✅ Adding new metrics to existing periods now preserves all previous data and adds the new metrics alongside them.

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Edit Functionality for Metrics

**Requirement:**
> Ensure that users can edit metric results for previous months.

**Implementation:**

### Backend API (backend/app.py)
**New Endpoint:** `PUT /api/initiatives/<id>/metrics/<period>/metric/<metric_name>` (Lines 460-515)
- Updates a specific metric within a period
- Fetches existing metrics JSON
- Updates only the specified metric
- Preserves all other metrics
- Updates `modified_at` timestamp

### Frontend - MetricsModal (frontend/src/components/MetricsModal.js)
1. **Edit State Management** (Line 14):
   - Added `editingMetric` state to track which metric is being edited

2. **Edit Handler** (Lines 98-105):
   - Captures metric details for editing
   - Shows inline edit form

3. **Save Handler** (Lines 107-122):
   - Sends PUT request to backend
   - Refreshes metrics list after save
   - Clears edit mode

4. **UI Components** (Lines 329-391):
   - Inline edit form with value and comments fields
   - Save and Cancel buttons
   - Edit button on each metric card

### Frontend - ProjectView (frontend/src/pages/ProjectView.js)
- Same edit functionality added (Lines 117-171)
- Edit buttons on metric cards (Lines 675-682)
- Inline edit forms (Lines 633-660)

**Result:** ✅ Users can now click "Edit" on any metric to update its value and comments inline.

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Delete Functionality for Metrics

**Requirement:**
> Ensure that users can delete metric results for previous months.

**Implementation:**

### Backend API (backend/app.py)
**New Endpoints:**
1. `DELETE /api/initiatives/<id>/metrics/<period>/metric/<metric_name>` (Lines 517-569)
   - Deletes a specific metric from a period
   - Fetches existing metrics
   - Removes the specified metric from JSON
   - Keeps all other metrics intact

2. `DELETE /api/initiatives/<id>/metrics/<period>` (Lines 571-589)
   - Deletes ALL metrics for an entire period
   - Removes the entire monthly_metrics row
   - Confirmation required on frontend

### Frontend - MetricsModal
1. **Delete Individual Metric** (Lines 124-138):
   - Confirmation dialog before deletion
   - Sends DELETE request for specific metric
   - Refreshes list after deletion

2. **Delete Entire Period** (Lines 140-152):
   - Deletes all metrics for a month
   - Separate confirmation dialog
   - Button in period header

3. **UI Components** (Lines 314-321, 379-386):
   - Delete button on each metric card
   - Trash icon in period header
   - Confirmation prompts

### Frontend - ProjectView
- Same delete functionality (Lines 143-170)
- Delete buttons on all metrics (Lines 683-690)
- Period delete button (Lines 618-625)

**Result:** ✅ Users can now delete individual metrics or entire periods with confirmation prompts.
