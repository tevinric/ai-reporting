## Database Schema Updates

Run these scripts in order:

### Option 1: Fresh Start (Recommended for Development)
```sql
-- 1. Drop all tables
USE AIReporting;
GO
EXEC sp_executesql N'C:\...\backend\sql_drop_all_tables.sql'

-- 2. Recreate all tables
EXEC sp_executesql N'C:\...\backend\sql_init_ai_reporting.sql'
```

### Option 2: Migration (For Production with Existing Data)
```sql
-- Add health_status to existing initiatives
ALTER TABLE initiatives ADD health_status NVARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Green';

-- Create risks table
-- (Copy CREATE TABLE statement from sql_init_ai_reporting.sql)

-- Add new field options
-- (Copy INSERT statements for health_status, frequency, severity)

-- Add indexes
CREATE INDEX IX_initiatives_health_status ON dbo.initiatives(health_status);
CREATE INDEX IX_risks_initiative ON dbo.risks(initiative_id);
```
